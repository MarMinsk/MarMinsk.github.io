<strong>General Assembly - Web Development Immersive - Project 4</strong>

Our final module introduced us to Ruby on Rails, object oriented programming, as well as SQL and relational databases, and furthered our exposure to token-based authentication.

For my final project, I wanted to create something that addressed a real-world problem. I created a site called ‘Mum Does That’, which is a skills and knowledge sharing platform for professional women on career breaks. Users can list skills they are happy to offer to other users or post details of task they need help with. The site aims to be a hub for highly skilled female professionals to share knowledge and experience.

The code for this project can be found <a href="https://github.com/MarMinsk/mum-does-that-client">here</a> and you can see the app <a href="https://infinite-taiga-30176.herokuapp.com/">here</a>.
