<strong>General Assembly - Web Development Immersive - Project 3</strong>

We completed our third project as a group, which, as well as consolidating our technical skills, gave us exposure to the dynamics of working as a team.

In this project, we relied heavily on Git for version control and Trello to manage our project workflow. We also expanded on some of the skills we had developed, by incorporating TDD, authentication, form validation and custom Angular directives into our project. Our team created a dog walking app called ‘Paws & Play’, which comprised an appropriate level of complexity as well as allowing scope to incorporate some fun and interesting styling and content.

The code for this project can be found <a href="https://github.com/MarMinsk/paws-and-play">here</a> and you can see the app <a href="https://github.com/MarMinsk/paws-and-play">here</a>.
