<strong>General Assembly - Web Development Immersive - Project 2</strong>

Our second module introduced us to the concepts of MVC design patterns, RESTful routing with Express.js, the Angular framework, Node.js for server-side JavaScript, and NoSQL with MongoDB. At the end of this module we built our first MEAN stack application.

I chose to build an application for my book club, called <em>‘Storyline’</em>, which is a reading resource and repository that allows users to add books, share comments about the books and make reading suggestions. Again, this was a site I had wanted to build for some time as a tool share with my friends and other book lovers.

The code for this project can be found <a href="https://github.com/MarMinsk/Storyline">here</a> and you can see the app <a href="https://limitless-waters-27769.herokuapp.com/">here</a>.
