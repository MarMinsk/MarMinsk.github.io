<strong>General Assembly - Web Development Immersive - Project 1</strong>

Our first module introduced us to HTML5, CSS and JavaScript as well as the process of software development, the basic principles of JavaScript scope, control flow, data types and functions, the jQuery library, and version control through Git and GitHub.

Our first project was to build a game of our choice. I built a memory game called ‘Knowing Underground’, that required the player to correctly match as many possible London Underground stations with their correct lines. I picked this game as I’m a bit of a train geek and it was something that I had wanted to build for some time to test my London Tube knowledge.

The code for this project can be found <a href="https://github.com/MarMinsk/Knowing-Underground">here</a> and you can see the app <a href="https://dry-shore-72116.herokuapp.com/">here</a>.
